### 👋 Hi there, 

Nice to meet you, and thank you for visiting my GitHub! 😄

My name is **Harish**. I am a data science associate and mentor in a bootcamp with a robust background in life-science research and an advanced degree in STEM and Management. 
Currently, I am working on **multidisciplinary data science projects** (including business analytics and biological sequence data analysis) where I apply my skills in analyzing datasets, data visualization, and developing machine learning models that drive actionable insights.
